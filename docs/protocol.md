# Request correlation and malformed frames

Aether uses newline-delimited JSON. A client frame carries a nonzero unsigned
64-bit correlation key in `req`; a server reply echoes it in `id`. A command's
own `id` (for example, the memory to forget) is unrelated to correlation.

The daemon reads `req` before decoding the command. Typed decoding failures,
including unknown fields in strict specifications, invalid enum values, and
missing required fields, receive `invalid_argument` at that request's ID, with
the decoding diagnostic. After a successful hello, these errors leave the
connection usable. A malformed hello receives its correlated diagnostic and
closes the connection.

If the daemon cannot read an unambiguous, nonzero `req` (including invalid JSON,
a missing, duplicate, zero, negative, fractional, or out-of-range ID), it sends
an `invalid_argument` reply with `id: 0`, then closes the connection. ID zero is
reserved for connection diagnostics. Clients retain that diagnostic and fail
all pending requests when the connection ends, rather than waiting for request
timeouts. Transport framing failures, such as an overlong line or invalid UTF-8,
may close without a JSON diagnostic; clients still fail pending requests on
closure.

This policy uses the existing reply shape and reserved ID-zero/closure contract;
it does not introduce an incompatible wire change or bump the protocol version.
The daemon applies it to both negotiated versions in its N/N-1 window. The
versioning contract and negotiation are defined in `aether-protocol`'s
`PROTOCOL_VERSION` and `compat` module.
